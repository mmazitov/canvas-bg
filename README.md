<h1 align="center">Particle Background Animation</h1>

## 🎯 About 
This project creates an interactive particle-based animation using the HTML5 canvas. Particles move, bounce off edges, and dynamically change color based on user interaction and screen size.

## ✨ Features
- Dynamic Particles: Particles are randomly generated and move independently.
- Interactive Effects: Particles react to the user's mouse movements.
- Responsive Design: The canvas and particles adjust to the window size.
- Dynamic Colors: Colors transition smoothly using the HSL color model.

## 🏁 Demo
Run the HTML and JavaScript to see the particle animation live.
